## Technologies
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python

Framework and Libraries: Flask, SQLite, Bootstrap

## Resoures 
Flask documentation, Bootstrap documentation

## Technology Comparisons
1. Flask vs. Django: Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, which is ideal for a project with a tight deadline. Django’s extensive features were not necessary for this project and could add unnecessary complexity.
2. Bootstrap vs. Material-UI: Bootstrap was chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration, allowing rapid development of a responsive and clean design without extensive customization. Material-UI is heavier than Bootstrap and may require more learning and customization to match my design requirements.

## Challenge

ELV Emporium intends to solve the problem of limited access to Extra-Low Voltage (ELV) gadgets in Nigeria. Many regions, even major urban centers, find it hard to get reliable and high-quality ELV products such as security systems, home automation devices, and networking equipment. ELV Emporium provides a one-stop online market that makes these products and installations more accessible to people, offering convenience and a reliable source for purchasing essential technology.
ELV Emporium’s target users are homeowners and businesses
The project is highly relevant to Nigeria, where ELV gadgets are not easily accessible in many regions including major cities. This site will bridge this gap by providing an online shopping platform that serves both urban and rural areas, potentially transforming the availability of advanced technology in Nigeria. 

## Risks
Technical Risk: 
This can be in integrating third-party services (APIs), and one of the ways I could safeguard this is by utilizing detailed documentation to address integration challenges. 
Non-Technical Risk: this would be me adding features beyond the initial scope which would lead to delays and increased complexity, impacting project deadlines. The strategy I’d use to curb this would be to define and document this project's requirements and scope from the beginning, focus on delivering the core functionality first, and consider additional features in future phases.

## Infrastructure
**Deployment Strategy:** The local environment would be used for initial development and testing. Then for production deployment, except otherwise stated, Netlify would be used to automate the deployment process.
Populating the App with Data: product listings, descriptions, and images will be used as initial data. An admin interface would be created to manage and update product data dynamically. API would be integrated to fetch and update data as needed.

**Testing Tools:** Manual Testing
